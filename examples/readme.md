# Examples 
Examples show ways to use the library.
The show features OR patterns of usage.
The can also show special nim-language use cases 
that can be relevant for a game.

The goal of examples is to show how to use the library
-> learning. The goal is not to be copied as a game
for that we have proto applications.
