# PROTO-APPLICATIONS

The Idea of proto applications is to provide 
applications that solve 80% of the problems, only 
leaving the last 20% of charackter giving features 
to the user. 

For example a proto-topdown-rts would implement a grid
a menu, zoom via camera, resource loader, basic factions
a basic campaign map, load, save, some units, some fighting
but leave the rest to the user.

## List of some possible proto applications (not exhaustive)

- proto-terraria
- proto isomorphic rts
- proto shooter
- round based games
- proto-sprite editor
- proto map editor
- proto multiplayer (hard)

- proto simulation (istn this a rts?)
