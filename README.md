# NimLove(2d) WIP!!

# THIS FILE IS BRAINSTORMING AND NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CURRENT STATE OF THE PROJECT

A super simple 2d framework for beginners and connoisseurs of love2d.


Since this project is especially for beginners, 
the comments also explain the basics of nim-syntax and inner workings
to get started.

With nimlove you get collection of simple game-prototypes to learn from
and mold in the image of your own game.
