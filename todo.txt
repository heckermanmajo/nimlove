- add all the callback-procs: keys and mouse stuff

- put global resources in resource folder

- write objects into csv lines
- use game objects as base

- add formatting for csv file, use ids and make them to eal refs
  - ref object

- own embeddable config/scripting language: lua
- and kek for even easier embedding


- add font loader as setup function 
   - only allow font loading before the gameloop starts

- Key-Capture-Modes
  - sometimes keys will be captured by other ui elements
    or handlers.
    So introduce a "capture mode" for keys adn the mouseclicks

- type into textfield-ui
- display different views
- add simple buttons: start of ui, like in imgui, "stateless": Gui module

- save al loaded images and sounds in a internal list, so we can
  log if multiple times the same resource is loaded

- add a grid module/tilemap module
- add aload and save example

- add a work splitter for heavy work
  you don't need to do all calculations in one frame
  -> f.e. "thinking" of units, pathfinding, etc.
  So cou can split out the work over multiple frames
  -> "coroutines"? maybe just create an iterator for this
     An iterator that takes in teh current time ans some params
     and only loops over the objects for that the work is scheduled


done:
- add a zoom in and out variable to the draw image proc
- get a simple texture atlas working: Make animations easy
